# ReadMe PDF merger

## Description

This python script merges all pdf files in the current Directory (PDFMerger) and combines them into a single PDF. The name of new PDf file is combined.pdf.

## Usage

## Future Upgrades

- take an argument as name for the new file
- Add an empty page to and pdf so you can print multple documents at one go
- think of a clever folder structure to manage the pdf to process and the proceeded files.
